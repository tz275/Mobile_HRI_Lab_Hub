## Reflection

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

No, surprisingly, everything seemed to work out well.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

In the firefighter robot, we could add a sound module into our robot to communicate with the people in need.
